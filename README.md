# C++ Practice
A repository to host all of the C++ projects I've worked on in the past.



The following were written solely by myself, while the rest were provided by professors:
  - `gaussian_elim.cpp`: solves a matrix equation using naive Gaussian elimination
  - `gaussElim.cpp`: performs PA = LU factorization on an n x n matrix, then solves the given matrix equation
  - `deck.cpp`: contains Card and Deck classes with sort, shuffle, and deal methods
